# Vetale Browser SuperLite — User Agreement (English)

**Effective date:** December 27, 2025  
**Product:** Vetale Browser SuperLite ("the App")  
**Developer contact:** vetalebrowser01@gmail.com  
**Built-in search service:** DuckDuckGo Lite — https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite

By selecting **Accept & Continue**, you confirm that you have read and agree to this User Agreement.

---

## 1. What this App is

Vetale Browser SuperLite is a lightweight desktop web browser for Windows built with **WPF** and **.NET Framework 4.8**, using **CefSharp.Wpf (Chromium Embedded Framework)** as the web engine.

It is designed for simple everyday browsing with:
- a minimal UI
- DuckDuckGo Lite search
- safety-first navigation rules

---

## 2. Consent and first launch

- On first launch, the App shows a User Agreement dialog.
- You must click **Accept & Continue** to use the App.
- If you click **Decline** or close the dialog, the App will close.
- When accepted, the App stores your acceptance **locally** to avoid showing the consent buttons again.

---

## 3. Online activity (how browsing works)

Web browsing requires network communication.

When you:
- open a website → your device connects to that website
- search → your query is sent to DuckDuckGo Lite

This is normal browser behavior.

---

## 4. External services

### 4.1 DuckDuckGo Lite (the only built-in service)

The App integrates DuckDuckGo Lite:
- https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite

When you use search:
- your search text is sent to DuckDuckGo
- DuckDuckGo returns results and content

DuckDuckGo is a third-party service. Their own terms and privacy policy apply.

### 4.2 Websites you visit

Every website you open is a third-party service.

Websites can:
- receive your IP address and standard HTTP/HTTPS request data
- run scripts, load resources, and display content
- store cookies/site data depending on the web engine configuration

---

## 5. Navigation safety behavior

To reduce accidental navigation to suspicious or unintended domains, the address input logic follows this rule:

- If the input looks like a clear **URL/domain** → open it directly
- Otherwise → perform a **DuckDuckGo Lite** search

Additionally:
- non-web schemes are blocked
- only **http/https** are allowed for direct navigation

This is a safety feature, but it does not guarantee protection from all threats.

---

## 6. Popups and new windows

The App is designed to prevent popups from opening as separate windows.

- popups/new windows are blocked
- navigation stays inside the main browser window

This is meant to reduce nuisance popups and confusing navigation paths.

---

## 7. Local data storage

The App may store some data **locally on your PC** to operate:
- basic settings (window size, UI preferences)
- browsing history (if enabled)
- cookies and website data (managed by the embedded web engine)
- your User Agreement acceptance flag

The App does not require you to create an account.

---

## 8. Security notice (important)

The App is built on an embedded browser engine (CefSharp/Chromium). Depending on version and platform limitations, embedded browser components may have security considerations.

**Important:** The App may be built using an older web component in some environments. The developer **cannot guarantee full security**.

You agree that you use the App **at your own risk**.

Safety recommendations:
- avoid entering passwords or payment details on unknown or untrusted websites
- keep Windows and antivirus up to date
- download files only from trusted sources

---

## 9. User responsibilities

You agree that you will:
- use the App in compliance with applicable laws
- not use the App for illegal activities
- understand that online content may be unsafe

---

## 10. Disclaimer

THE APP IS PROVIDED **"AS IS"**, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.

The developer is not responsible for:
- third-party websites and their content
- third-party terms/policies
- malware, phishing, scams, or unsafe content you may encounter online
- damages resulting from use of the App or the websites you visit

---

## 11. Updates to this agreement

The developer may update this agreement in future versions of the App.

If the agreement changes significantly, the App may show an updated consent screen.
